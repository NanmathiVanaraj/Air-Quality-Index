# Air-Quality-Index
Developed an AQI forecasting model using time-series analysis and seasonal decomposition to study long-term trends, seasonal variations, and rainfall influence on air quality. Applied machine learning models to predict AQI levels and evaluate pollution patterns for improved environmental monitoring.
